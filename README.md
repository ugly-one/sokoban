# Sokoban
I found 2 vides on youtube about "how to make Sokoban in Haskell"
1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtvoOIsN-GU
2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UashNDejcHo

So I followed along and made my own version.
Wheneven the author said "I will not implement this method...", I stopped the video and tried to implement it myself and then compared the results

How to play:
- use arrows to move
- ctrt+z for undo

Main.hs runs either console version or a GUI version. Console version uses "w" "s" "a" "d" keys to move the worker

TODO: allow different maps, currently it's possible to play only on one :)
